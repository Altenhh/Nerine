# Nerine.NET
##### A quick, optimal database made for simplicity and usability.
----

Nerine is a C# serverless database software that aims to be an easy malleable package with key similarities to common databases that are attached to servers, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL; whilst having the key simplicity and replicability of file based databases, like SQLite, and the lack of SQL in places like MongoDB, Redis, and more.

# Objectives
This package aims to be easy to understand and use, while having all the benefits of binary storage and high-class performance.
* Provide full coverage of the [Nerine database specifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altenhh/Nerine/master/Nerine/FileStructure.txt).
* Keep up to date with whats needed in the Nerine ecosystem.

Good ideas on what to contribute can be found on the [list of opened issues](https://github.com/Altenhh/Nerine/ISSUES), primarily those labelled "bugs", or are "suggestions".

While we don't (yet) have a specific set of standards for contributions, we would appreciate those who wish to contribute to always make their tests with the project in the `Nerine.Tests` namespace, in its proper folder.
